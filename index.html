        <h1>The perfect trip</h1>
        
        <p>My perfect trip would be to St. George Utah with my best friends. We would stay up late watching movies, eating candy, and drinking soda.</p>

        <p>We would see lots of different kinds of animals, but my favorite is the Duskpin-Ultimate</p>

        <p>We would also eat the most amazing blue leaves.</p>
